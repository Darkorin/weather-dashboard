# weather-dashboard

This is a weather dashboard app that I made for my homework.
It fetches weather data from the open weather API for a searched city.
It retains 10 cities in a recently searched list and you can click any of them
to see their weather data. It also instantly pulls up the most recently searched city
from the local storage and display its data on page reload.
In addition I used a third party API called Algolia to add auto-fill support to the 
search bar.
